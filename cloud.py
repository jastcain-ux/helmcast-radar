"""HRRR total cloud cover, rendered as a translucent layer.

A scalar field like reflectivity, so unlike wind it ships as pictures and
reuses the radar renderer's Lambert-to-mercator sampling directly.

**Capped well short of opaque, deliberately.** A cloud layer was tried once
before on this project and rejected: as a base-map replacement it put a grey
sheet over everything and told a boater nothing. That objection is weaker for a
layer someone chooses to switch on, but it is not wrong — so cover maxes out
around half opacity, and the coastline, the place names and the radar
underneath stay readable through the thickest overcast.

Hourly only: TCDC is not in the sub-hourly files, and cloud does not change
meaningfully in fifteen minutes anyway.
