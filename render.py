"""
Render NOAA HRRR forecast reflectivity to PNG frames SeaWise can draw.

Why this exists
---------------
Radar measures what is already in the air. NOAA publishes no *forecast*
reflectivity as ready-made map tiles — it exists only as HRRR model output in
GRIB2 on NOMADS. Every consumer app showing "future radar" is either
extrapolating recent frames (good for about an hour) or rendering this same
model, usually bought from a vendor.

The data is free and public domain. The only missing piece was something to
turn the files into images, which is all this is.

What it does
------------
Finds the newest HRRR run, downloads *only* the composite reflectivity record
from each forecast hour using the GRIB index sidecar (about 0.3 MB each rather
than the ~130 MB full file), reprojects from the model's Lambert grid to web
mercator, and writes one national PNG per hour plus a manifest.

Honesty rules that are not optional
-----------------------------------
- A frame that could not be produced is ABSENT from the manifest, never
  substituted with a neighbouring hour. The app says "no frame for this hour"
  rather than showing 3 PM's weather under a 6 PM label.
- The manifest carries the model run time, so the app can show how old the
  forecast is. A six-hour outlook from a run that stopped updating four hours
  ago is not a six-hour outlook.
- Below 5 dBZ is transparent. Drizzle nobody can feel must not paint the bay.

# QUARTER-HOURS because that is HRRR's own sub-hourly cadence — these are real

# squall line approach: at 25 knots a storm crosses fifteen miles between
# frames, which on a 60-mile map is a jump rather than a movement.
#
# NINE HOURS, although the app only scrubs six. The newest complete run is
# always one to two hours behind the wall clock, so a series starting at run+1h
# ran out before the end of a six-hour scrubber and the last steps fell back to
# the wind field — a flat blue wash that read as "the radar turned blue".
#
# Three hours of margin is deliberate: past three hours the manifest reads as
# stale and the app says so out loud, so covering further would only be padding
# a window the screen has already disowned.

# Regional cells, the same correction the measured half already had.
#
# A national frame cannot serve the zoom a boater actually uses: 35 miles of
# water out of a country-wide picture is a few dozen pixels, and blown up to a
# phone it is mush. That was fixed for the measured frames and never applied
# here, which is why the forecast half looked so much worse than the past half
# on the same screen — about seven times harder magnified before it was drawn.
#
# The cells are COARSER than the measured ones on purpose. MRMS is a 1 km
# mosaic and earns 0.2 km/px; HRRR is a 3 km model, so past roughly 200 px per
# degree the extra pixels carry no extra information and only cost bytes and
# render time. Ten by seven degrees at 2000 x 1400 is ~200 px/degree — about
# six times what the national frame gave, and honest about the model's limit.
#
# Fewer, bigger cells also keep the run affordable: every lead time is rendered
# into every cell, so 36 steps against the measured half's 25 cells would be
# 900 frames an hour.
# The forecast layout lives in `cells.py` beside the measured one.
# Written as a 256-colour PNG, for the same reason the measured frames are: a
# third of the bytes, and indistinguishable side by side because the picture
# only ever contains ramp colours at a fixed set of alphas.

# Median-cut was tried first and failed the whole run: Pillow's median-cut
# only accepts RGB, and every frame carries an alpha fade. The two manual runs
# that would have published it both died in the measured step, so nothing
# published at all — which is the one outcome worse than a coarse palette.
#
# The octree is what we had; the dither is new. Octree still chooses the 256
# entries (badly, on slow gradients — 57 of 256 used on a 96-step frame), but
# dithering turns what steps remain into noise the eye reads as gradient
# rather than bands. Legacy constants, not the `Image.Dither` enum, because the
# runner's Pillow is whatever pip gives it and the enum is newer than some of
# those. If this still collapses the ramp, the next step is full-colour PNGs
# for the forecast and nowcast tiers at about three times the bytes.
# "rgba": no palette and no dither. The dither was the grain Jason saw in every

# covers a wide area. It read as exactly the blockiness the cubic sampling was
# added to remove, and no amount of smoothing upstream could survive being

# corresponds to nothing in the weather.
#
# **24 was not enough, and the claim that 16 looked like 48 was wrong.** It was
# judged on a national frame, where one step spanned a few pixels. On the
# middle tier at a one-degree view each step is ~3 dBZ, and where rain varies
# slowly a single step covers a wide flat area — so the picture became
# plateaus with hard edges between them. Jason read it as pixelation, and it
# was: not the 3 km model's, ours. Verified 2026-09-02 by cropping the
