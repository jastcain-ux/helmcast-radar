"""HRRR 10-metre wind, as a vector field the app animates.

Radar and cloud are scalar fields and are published as pictures. Wind is not —
a picture of wind is arrows someone else chose. What the app needs is the
vectors themselves, so it can move particles along them and let the *motion*
carry direction and speed.

**Encoded as a PNG, not JSON.** The grid is 0.05 degrees, which is 100x80 values
per cell for each of u and v. As JSON that is about 110 KB a frame; as a
two-channel PNG it is a few KB, because that is precisely what image
compression is for. R carries u, G carries v, both scaled from a range stated
in the manifest. B is unused.

10 metres, not 80: it is the height wind is quoted at for boating and the
height every threshold in the rating engine is expressed in.
