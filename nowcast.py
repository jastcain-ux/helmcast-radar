"""Extrapolated measured radar: the last two MRMS frames, motion-tracked forward.

The reference apps' forecast stays crisp for the first hour or two because it
is not a model at all — it is the newest measured frame moved along the motion
seen between it and the one before. Ours went to HRRR's 3 km grid at
+15 minutes, which is why our forecast half could never look as sharp as our
measured half however well it was drawn. D-64.

**What this is, and is not.** It moves rain; it does not grow or kill it. A
steady system tracks for an hour or two; developing or collapsing convection
will not, and every app's nowcast shares that limit. The app captions these
frames "projected from the last hour" and never "forecast" — D-57. The manifest
says `"source": "extrapolation"` so nothing downstream can mistake it.

**Motion.** Block-wise phase correlation between the two newest frames on a
pooled grid: one vector per ~250 km block, smoothed, with blocks that have too
little echo to correlate inheriting their neighbours'. A single national vector
was tried first in thought and rejected — a front over Texas and a sea-breeze
line over Florida do not move together.

**Cost.** Wide tier at half resolution plus the national frame, eight leads.
The close cells are deliberately absent: an advected field is already a smear
of the source, and 480 px/degree of a smear costs render time for nothing. The
app's tier chooser then picks the wide frame at close zoom, which is the right
picture. Stamp-keyed on the newest MRMS frame, so a ten-minute tick that brings
no new frame renders nothing.

    caught by a synthetic two-storm test rather than on the runner:

    - Empty windows used to *borrow* the nearest tracked vector, and the field
      was then smoothed. A storm in a corner window had neighbours nearer to a
      different storm, borrowed that storm's opposite motion, and the smoothing
      averaged its own motion down to a fifth. Weighting by how much echo
      supported each vector means a storm's own window decides at the storm,
      and an empty region takes a smooth blend of whatever motion is nearest
      *in proportion to its evidence* — never a hard borrow.
    - Windows were tiled edge to edge, so a storm's position relative to a
      window edge changed the answer. Overlapping windows centre one near it.
