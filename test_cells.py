"""The cell layouts must cover the water SeaWise serves.

A gap here does not fail loudly, which is exactly why it needs a test. The
app falls back — the measured half to NOAA's tiles, the forecast half to the
NWS gust field — and a flat blue wash has twice been mistaken for the radar
being broken. Nothing in a rendered frame tells you a boater's own bay fell
between two cells; only this does.
